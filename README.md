## File Contains implementation of few Deep Neural Network Models which are being used for Image classifaction 

# Below models are mostly taken from different research papers and it includes implemtation of those models

List of different Convolutional Network Models present in the file.

1. Xception-Network
2. DenseNet-121
3. DenseNet-169
4. DenseNet-201
5. VGG-16
6. VGG-19
7. resnet-50
8. ResNet-101
9. ResNet-152
10. Sqeeze_and_Excitation_Network
11. AlexNet

You can simply import the pthon file and make model simply by calling the functions present in the file.
You just need to pass few arguments like size of image given in input, output size etc and some other based on tweeking the cnn models.
